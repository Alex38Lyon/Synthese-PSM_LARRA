Scripts for Therion
====================

pyThtoDat
---------

Script to convert a database (.sql) generated by Therion
into Compass (.dat) and (.mak) files

Usage: python pyThtoDat.py  

How to use:  
	- Export the .sql file with Therion using the following command in the .thconfig file: 'export database -o Outputs/database.sql'
